# simple-web-app using Django
I already had intalled Python and IDE (text editer) so I only installed Django 

#### Creating a project
This is my first time using Django, I’ll have to take care of some initial setup. 
Namely, I’ll need to auto-generate some code that establishes a Django project – a collection of settings for an instance of Django, 
including database configuration, Django-specific options and application-specific settings.

#### made a directory where my web-app will be
from command promt went to the directry and ran
```
django-admin startproject mysite
```
This creates a mysite directory in the current directory. (Initial setup done)
